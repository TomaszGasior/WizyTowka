WizyTówka 5
===

Simple PHP-written content management system for small websites. Currently in development. Licensed on 3-clause BSD license.

The repository is divided into four separate directories:

* `code` — main code directory; only files from here are needed to build releases and run this application;
* `tests` — unit tests, based on PHP Unit framework;
* `docs` — documentation files, written in Polish using Markdown files; there is no inline code documentation;
* `others` — additional files: command line utility scripts, some configuration files, artworks.

The user interface uses Polish as one supported language as this project is indented to be used by Polish websites.
